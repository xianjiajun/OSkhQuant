# Issues

- basedpyright baseline: `khFrame.py` reports many pre-existing type errors; use as baseline and avoid adding new runtime/syntax errors; rely on `python -m py_compile` + smoke runs for verification.


## F1 Plan Compliance Audit (2026-02-27 23:07:41)
- Deliverables exist in worktree but are untracked: `api.py`, `backtest_result.py`, `smoke_dual_mode.py`.
- Evidence exists for tasks 8/9/10/12, but task-10 failure evidence file is empty and task-12 matrix error output is minimal.
- Evidence referenced by plan is missing for tasks 1-7 and 11 (see plan Evidence list).
